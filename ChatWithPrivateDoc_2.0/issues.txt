Question:
Lineage of Yayati from prajapati onwards 

Answer:
I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific documents or sources to provide the lineage of Yayati from prajapati onwards. If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask. 

Issue - There is a direct reference of yayati in mahabharat for being the 10th from yayati. The lineage can be tracked with a few gaps.

Question:
what is relation between shukracharya and brihaspati? 

Answer:
Shukracharya and Brihaspati are both important figures in Hindu mythology. Shukracharya is known as the guru of the Asuras (demons), while Brihaspati is the guru of the Devas (gods). They are often depicted as rivals due to their allegiances to opposing groups. Shukracharya is associated with wisdom, occult knowledge, and protection of the Asuras, while Brihaspati represents righteousness, devotion, and guidance for the Devas.

Issue- Or may be feature, Its picking not from source document. But ideally first reference should be from the reference book.

Did some testing and working fine except few out of the document reference.
Sometime K need to be adjusted higher side to get the right context to answer it properly.
